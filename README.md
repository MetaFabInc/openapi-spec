# OpenAPI Spec

This repository contains the latest OpenAPI 3.0 spec for MetaFab's APIs.

You may use this spec for things like auto-generating SDKs for languages or frameworks we may not have out of the box support for yet.

The spec.json file contained in this repository is always up to date and automatically updated anytime our production APIs are updated with new features, changed endpoints, and more.
